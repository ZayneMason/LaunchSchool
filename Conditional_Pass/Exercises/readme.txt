The folder "Ruby_Files" contains the exercises I have decided to use for my conditional pass assignment.
Some quick things of note when viewing these files:
- Any time there is a comment with two '##', it was a line of code I used for purposes of debugging or testing code.
- I placed implementation notes in the form of comments in the code breaking down what is happening in each stage, as per what I outlined in my algorithms.
- At the bottom of each file you can find my two solutions without any clutter of notes or debugging lines.
