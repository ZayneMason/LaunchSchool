On ``line 4`` we define the method ``repeat_times``. It has two parameters, ``str`` and ``amount``. ``str`` references a string as an argument, while ``amount`` references an integer. ``line 5`` invokes the ``times`` method on ``amount`` with a block. The block passes the variable ``str`` to the ``puts`` method. The return value is ``nil``, however the string object ``str`` is refrencing is output the string ``str`` references the integer ``amount`` references, times.
After ``repeat_times`` finishes outputting, it will return ``nil``.
