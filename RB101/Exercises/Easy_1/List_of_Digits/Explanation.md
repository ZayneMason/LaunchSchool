``Line 4`` defines our method ``digit_list`` with one parameter ``number``. ``Line 5`` has the variable ``number``, which represents an integer passed as an arguument, and invokes the ``to_s`` method, converting it into a string object. Once ``number`` is converted into a string, we invoke the ``split`` method on that string, ``split`` is used to create an array out of words in a string, when we pass the argument ``''``, it ensures that each character in the string is an individual element in the array. 

Now that we have an array of the individual integers, still in the form of string objects, we invoke the method ``each`` method on that array. We pass a block to ``each``, setting a parameter ``num`` that will reference each item in our array. We then invoke ``to_i`` on num to convert each ``num`` back into integer objects.
