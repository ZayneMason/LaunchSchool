``line 16`` defines a method ``count_occurences`` that has one parameter ``arr``. ``Line 17`` initializes a variable ``vehicle_count`` that points to a (currently) empty hash object. On ``line 19`` the array that the variable ``arr`` (representing an array we pass as an argument) has the ``uniq`` method invoked on it, removing any duplicate elements. 
The new return array then has ``each`` invoked on it with a block. The block has one parameter ``vehicle`` representing the items in the array. The hash ``vehicle_count`` is given a new key for each ``vehicle`` and assigned a value of the return of the ``count`` method, invoked on the original ``arr`` and passed the argument ``vehicle``.
This makes the ``vehicle_count`` hash contain a key representing each vehicle type, assigned to a total count of how many times it occurs.
On ``line 20`` we invoke the ``each`` method on the ``vehicle_count`` hash with a block. The block's parameter for keys is ``vehicle`` and values is ``count``. The block uses the ``puts`` method to output a message that contains the element for each ``vehicle`` and its value ``count``.
``count_occurences`` will return the ``vehicle_count`` hash, but will have the side-effect of outputting each ``vehicle`` and ``count`` alongside each other.
