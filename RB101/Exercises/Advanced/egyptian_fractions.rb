# A Rational Number is any number that can be represented as the result of the division between two integers, e.g.,
# 1/3, 3/2, 22/7, etc. The number to the left is called the numerator, and the number to the right is called the denominator
# A unit fraction is a rational number where the numerator is 1
# An Egyptian Fraction is the sum of a series of distinct unit fractions (no two are the same), such as:
# 1   1    1    1
# - + - + -- + --
# 2   3   13   15

# Every positive number can be written as an egyptian fraction. For example:
#     1   1   1   1
# 2 = - + - + - + -
#     1   2   3   6

# Write two methods: one that takes a Rational number as an argument, and returns an Array of the denominators that are part of an Egyptian Fraction representation of the number, 
# and another that takes an array of numbers in the same format and calculates the resulting rational number. You will need to use the rational class provided by Ruby.
